# Fuel Station Management System

The Fuel Station Management System is designed to streamline the operations of a fuel station by efficiently managing employee details, fuel suppliers, customers, and their associated information. The project harnesses the power of Java's object-oriented programming (OOP) capabilities and database connectivity to ensure a robust and scalable solution.

## Key Features:

### Employee Management:
- Maintains comprehensive records of employees, including personal information and job roles.
- Implements role-based access control to ensure that employees can only access information and perform actions relevant to their roles.

### Fuel Supplier Management:
- Keeps detailed records of fuel suppliers, including contact information, fuel types supplied, and pricing.
- Tracks orders placed with suppliers, including order dates, quantities, and delivery statuses.
- Updates fuel inventory automatically upon receiving deliveries, ensuring accurate stock levels.

### Customer Management:
- Creates profiles for regular customers, storing information such as contact details, fuel purchase history, and payment preferences.

## Technical Implementation:

### Object-Oriented Design:
- Utilizes Java's OOP capabilities to create classes representing various entities within the system, such as `Employee`, `Supplier`, `Customer`, and `Transaction`.

### Database Connectivity:
- Connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve persistent data. Utilizes JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for efficient database operations.
- Executes SQL queries to manage data within the database, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employees, suppliers, customers, and transactions.

### User Interface:
- GUI Development:
- Develops a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing, allowing users to interact with the system effortlessly.
- Implements intuitive navigation menus and forms for easy data entry, updates, and retrieval.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to managing the various facets of a fuel station, utilizing Java's OOP capabilities and robust database connectivity to ensure a reliable and scalable system.
